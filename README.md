# Restore Closed Tabs: A Chrome Extension
A very minimal chrome extension to open recently closed tabs.
**Works exactly like Ctrl+Shift+T but as a pinned button.**

## 🚀 Installation
1. **Download** or clone this repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
4. Click **Load unpacked** → Select this folder
5. **Pin** to toolbar (click pin icon)

Test: Close a tab → Click extension icon → Tab reopens.
